## What You Need to Know About QR Codes

### Overview

QR codes are a type of barcode that stores information and can be scanned using a smartphone or tablet camera.  When scanned, the QR code opens a link, launches an app feature, or displays a message.

The goal of this article is to help you understand QR codes by explaining their purpose, functionality, components, advantages, and how to create them.

### About QR codes

A Quick Response (QR) code is a type of two-dimensional barcode made up of small squares and patterns that store digital information—such as links to websites, videos, or calendar events. When scanned with a smartphone or tablet, the QR code quickly directs users to the encoded content. QR codes are commonly used on banners, business cards, flyers, posters, and other print or digital materials.

There are two main types of QR codes:

* **Static QR Codes**: These are fixed and cannot be edited after creation. Once the data is embedded, it cannot be changed, and no tracking data is available. Static codes are best for simple, one-time uses—such as on resumes, personal business cards, or short-term promotions.
* **Dynamic QR Codes**: These offer more flexibility and functionality. You can update the content even after the code has been printed and access analytics such as scan count, scan location, and device types. Dynamic codes are ideal for restaurants, public services, and businesses that need real-time data tracking or frequently updated content.

### Functionality of QR codes

QR codes can be scanned using most smart devices, including iPhones, Android phones, and tablets. Many of these devices have built-in QR code scanners within the camera app, while others offer QR reader apps that can be downloaded. These tools make it easy to scan a QR code and instantly access the embedded content. 

Thanks to their two-dimensional design, QR codes can be scanned from any orientation—vertically, horizontally, or at an angle—making them both convenient and versatile for everyday use.

### Components of QR codes

QR codes consist of the following components:

* **Quiet Zone**: The blank margin surrounding the QR code that prevents the scanner from reading external visual elements as part of the code.
* **Finder Pattern**: Three large squares positioned in three corners of the QR code that help the scanner recognize the code and determine its orientation.
* **Alignment Pattern**: A smaller square, usually near the bottom-right corner, that ensures the QR code can be read correctly from any angle.
* **Timing Pattern**: A sequence of alternating black and white modules forming an L-shape, which helps the scanner detect individual data cells and maintain alignment, even if part of the code is damaged.
* **Version Information**: Encoded near the top-right finder pattern, this identifies the QR code version to the scanner for accurate decoding.
* **Data Cells**: The small black and white squares within the code that store the actual information—such as URLs, contact details, or text messages.

### Advantages of QR codes

One of the advantages of QR codes is that they provide businesses with a digital dimension that they can use in a variety of ways, such as:

* Offering instant access to information, such as menus, product details, or contact forms.
* Supporting marketing efforts by linking to promotions, landing pages, or social media, which can boost customer engagement and drive conversions.

Another advantage is that QR codes are reliable. Unlike traditional barcodes, QR codes can function even when damaged because of their built-in error correction design; this means that even if a QR code gets damaged, it can still find the correct redirection.
